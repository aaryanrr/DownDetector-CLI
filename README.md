# CLI for [DownDetector](https://downdetector.com/)

## Description

> *It scrapes the status message from DownDetector's Website and shows it in the terminal.
So you don't need to open up the Website for checking the status of a service.*

### Recent Updates (December 2025)

The scraper has been updated to work with the modern DownDetector website structure:
- ✅ Improved bot detection bypass with modern browser headers
- ✅ Multi-strategy HTML parsing for resilience against website changes
- ✅ Better error handling and timeout support
- ✅ Backward compatible with older website structures

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed changes.
